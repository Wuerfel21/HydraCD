README.TXT for \DEMOS directory.

This directory contains all the sources for the "demo coders" programs. 
The majority of the programs are already in the \SOURCES directory; however,
these sources are more oraganized and seperated.

The ZIP versions of each folder are the original sources before compatibility
testing and modification. They are there for reference only. If you want to load
any of the demos, you are suggested to use the versions of the source in the 
exploded directories. Chapter 25 outlines each of the demos as well.
