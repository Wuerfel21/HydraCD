README.TXT for \media directory.

This directory contains the graphic and audio media for the book.
The assets are contained in two sub-directories:

\graphics   - Contains graphics assets.
    |
    \spritelib - Royalty free sprite and graphics library by Ari Feldman, see license for details.
    
\audio      - Contains audio assets.

The audio and graphics assets are royalty free for non-commercial use ONLY
and can be included as part of your games and applications, but can't be licensed,
sold, distributed or otherwise transferred by themselves unless part of a larger
game or application. The "Spritelib" assets carry their own license, so please 
refer to that within the \spritelib directory itself.
