README.TXT for \sources directory.

This is the primary sources directory for the entire book. It contains all the
top level Propeller files for all the demos, games, and applications. Also, within
this directory are C sources and executables for the asset management tools:

BMP2SPIN - Converts BMP files to SPIN.
MAP2SPIN - Converts MAP files to SPIN.
RAW2SPIN - Converts RAW audio files to SPIN.

Additionally, there are other tools such as:

XGSBMP - General file conversion program for graphics and sounds.

The book outlines any such tools. 

Additionally, there is source "residue" from development, better to keep the files there
in case you might find the useful than to delete them. However, the only programs, demos,
and games that work are the ones that are outlined in the book. Anything else might not
compile or work.
